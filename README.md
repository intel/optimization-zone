# Intel Optimization Zone - Intel Tuning Guides

This repository contains a collection of Intel tuning guides and Intel optimization recipes specifically designed for software running on Intel. Our comprehensive resources include detailed configuration recommendations, performance tuning techniques, and best practices to help you unlock the full potential of your Intel infrastructure.

## What You'll Find Here

### üóÑÔ∏è Databases & Data Stores Tuning Guides

Tuning Guides and optimization guides for popular database systems including Cassandra, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, covering configuration tuning, memory management, and query optimization strategies.

### ‚ö° Big Data & Analytics Tuning Guides

Performance tuning for Apache Spark and Gluten, with focus on vectorization, memory optimization, and efficient data processing on Intel architectures.

### üìä Industry-Standard Benchmarks

Configuration and execution guides for TPC-DS, TPC-H, and Cassandra Stress workloads, enabling you to measure and validate your optimization results.

### üöÄ Goal

We aim to provide a dynamic resource where users can find the latest optimization strategies, contribute feedback, and report issues.
