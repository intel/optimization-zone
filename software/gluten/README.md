# Apache Gluten (Incubating): A Middle Layer for Offloading JVM-based SQL Engines' Execution to Native Engines

Apache Gluten is an open-source project designed to accelerate Apache Spark SQL by enabling native, vectorized query execution using high-performance C++ backends. Developed by Intel, Gluten decouples Spark’s execution engine from the JVM and integrates with native engines like Velox or ClickHouse, allowing Spark to leverage modern CPU features such as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) and cache-efficient memory layouts. This results in significant performance improvements, especially for analytical workloads. Gluten is fully compatible with Spark APIs, making it easy to adopt without changing existing Spark applications, and is particularly well-suited for cloud-native OLAP and large-scale data processing environments.

Gluten currently supports multiple backends, including Velox and ClickHouse. Each backend has its own characteristics—for example, ClickHouse tends to deliver better performance for smaller queries, while Velox excels in handling longer or more complex queries. Intel® recommends using the Velox backend for running ETL workloads.

# Gluten related Parameter Tuning

| Parameters | Description | Recommend Setting |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| spark.executor.instances | |Depends on total cores per host and related to cores setting |
| spark.executor.cores | | Recommend to allocate 4 to 8 cores per executor. Please note that using an odd number of cores is not advised on systems with Simultaneous Multithreading(SMT) enabled|
| spark.executor.memory | | At least 0.5GB-1GB per core. Please note too small heap memory size could trigger GC and hurt the performance.|
| spark.executor.memoryOverhead | | Keep a few memory size for memoryOverhead |
| spark.memory.offHeap.enabled | Gluten uses offHeap memory for the native engine. | true  |
| spark.memory.offHeap.size | Set up offHeap memory size | In fully offload cases, please allocate as much memory as possible for offHeap. |
| spark.executorEnv.LD_PRELOAD | Set the location of pre-installed libjemalloc.so. Using jemalloc improved performance up to 10% in our testing. | /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2 |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.backend.velox.memoryCapRatio | Gluten v1.0.0 use memoryCapRatio to set up how much memory to be used in offHeap. Please see the <u>Spill</u> section in the [Velox](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten/blob/branch-1.0/docs/get-started/Velox.md#spill-experimental) Getting Started Guide. | 0.75 |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.forceshuffledhashjoin | Recommend using **SHJ** instead of **SMJ**, native **SHJ** can provide better performance; current native **SMJ** still has some performance issues. | true |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.maxBatchSize | | 4096 |
| spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes | This parameter can impact the number of tasks in Scan stage. To set up 2GB or more to get better performance for native scan. | At least 2GB |
| spark.sql.shuffle.partitions | We usually set 2x total cores for better performance, if you are facing OOM issue, please set it to 3x or higher. For example, in our environment there are 144 total cores, we set 144 x2 = 288 as shuffle partitions. | 2x total cores |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.wholeStage.fallback.threshold| | Gluten disables this setting by default. However, if your workload includes many unsupported fallback operators, we recommend setting it to 1 or 2.|
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.query.fallback.threshold | This parameter can only work when AQE is disabled | |
| spark.sql.optimizer.runtime.bloomFilter.applicationSideScanSizeThreshold | | 0 |
| spark.sql.optimizer.runtime.bloomFilter.enabled | | true |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.joinOptimizationLevel | | 18. Intend to fallback to JVM engine when consequent join happen like q72 in TPC-DS. |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.logicalJoinOptimizationLevel | | 19. Intend to fallback to JVM engine when consequent join happen like q72 in TPC-DS. |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.logicalJoinOptimizeEnable | | true. Intend to fallback to JVM engine when consequent join happen like q72 in TPC-DS. |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.physicalJoinOptimizationLevel | | 18. Intend to fallback to JVM engine when consequent join happen like q72 in TPC-DS. |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.physicalJoinOptimizeEnable | | true |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.numaBinding | | Set true for bare metal and false for Cloud environment. |
| spark.gluten.sql.columnar.coreRange | | This parameters only works when numaBinding is enabled. Please use numactl tool to find the detailed NUMA topology then set the number to align with the NUMA topology in the Intel® processor. |

## Differences between Spark and Gluten in the Memory setting
In Spark, the total executor memory is calculated as:
```
total executor memory = executor.memory + executor.memoryOverhead + offHeap.size.
```
Spark workloads typically rely on executor.memory settings to achieve better performance and avoid out-of-memory (OOM) issues.

In Gluten, the native backend requires more off-heap memory, so we recommend configuring a larger spark.memory.offHeap.size to improve performance and reduce the risk of OOM errors.

## Other Performance Considerations
In addition to optimizing the Spark and Gluten configuration, it is crucial to monitor CPU utilization. CPU utilization may reach 80-90% if I/O is not the limiting factor.

In cloud environments using Gluten, I/O can easily become the performance bottleneck. If we observe low CPU utilization (e.g., 50-60%), I/O may be the bottleneck. In this case, we recommend increasing the storage and/or network bandwidth to improve performance.

For our bare metal testing, we utilized 6 NVMe disks and a 100Gb network to ensure that I/O was not a bottleneck. This setup allowed us to achieve a 2.71x speedup in TPC-H and a 2.29x speedup in TPC-DS benchmarks with Gluten v1.0.0.

# Intel® Optimizations
Apache Gluten has been enabled with Intel-specific features for improved performance.

## AVX
For details about SIMD in Velox, please refer to [Velox SIMD](https://facebookincubator.github.io/velox/develop/simd.html).
AVX-512 support is limited across operators in Velox. However in some scenarios, AVX-512 can provide performance gains.

## JSON
Velox uses AVX-512 for JSON parsing Velox through [SIMDJSON](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) to achieve better performance.

## Columnar Shuffle
Gluten leverages AVX-512 to implement Columnar Shuffle. Users can also choose a compression codec with AVX-512 optimizations to get better performance or a higher compression ratio during the shuffle phase.

## Intel® QuickAssist Technology (Intel® QAT)
Please refer to [Gluten QAT](https://apache.github.io/incubator-gluten/get-started/VeloxQAT.html#build-gluten-with-qat).
QAT-zip or QAT-zstd codecs are used to accelerate the compression and decompression in Columnar Shuffle.
In our testing environment, we found that Intel® QAT can provide up to a 20% performance gain. The performance gain achieved will vary and has a dependency on the number of cores and the number of QAT devices per socket.
We use 16-32 vcores per instance with 2 QAT devices in our testing. Using more vcores may cause some tasks to queue while waiting for a QAT device to become available and result in performance degradation.

## Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA)
Please refer to [Velox IAA](https://apache.github.io/incubator-gluten/get-started/VeloxIAA.html).
Intel® IAA is also supported for compression and decompression, but we have not yet observed performance gains in our testing environment.

## High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)
Please refer to [Velox HBM](https://apache.github.io/incubator-gluten/get-started/VeloxHBM.html).
