# Intel® Performance Counter Monitor (Intel® PCM)

Intel® Performance Counter Monitor (Intel® PCM) is an application programming interface (API) and a set of tools based on the API to monitor performance and energy metrics of Intel® Core™, Xeon®, Atom™ and Xeon Phi™ processors. PCM works on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and ChromeOS operating systems.

## Key Features
- real-time monitoring of key processor metrics
- monitor memory bandwidth (per-channel and per-DRAM DIMM rank)
- monitor cache miss latencies
- monitor PCIe bandwidth
- monitor sleep and energy states of processor
- exposes metrics to collectors such as Prometheus
