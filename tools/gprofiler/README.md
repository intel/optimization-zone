# Intel® gProfiler and Intel® gProfiler Performance Studio

## Intel® gProfiler

Intel® gProfiler is a system-wide profiler, combining multiple sampling profilers to produce unified visualization of what your CPU is spending time on. It displays stack traces, as flame graphs, of all processes running on your system across native programs (includes Golang), Java and Python runtimes, and kernel routines. Optionally, it can upload its results to a self-hosted instance of Intel® gProfiler Performance Studio.

Intel® gProfiler Performance Studio is a self-hosted solution that aggregates the results from multiple gProfiler instances over different periods of time and can give you a holistic view of what is happening on your entire cluster.
