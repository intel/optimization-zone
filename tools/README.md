# Tools

This directory contains documentation for performance monitoring and profiling tools used in optimization work.

## Tool Summaries

**Intel® gProfiler** - A system-wide profiler that combines multiple sampling profilers to visualize CPU usage across native programs, Java, Python runtimes, and kernel routines. It also includes Intel® gProfiler Performance Studio, a self-hosted solution for aggregating results from multiple instances.

**Intel® Performance Counter Monitor (PCM)** - An API and toolset for monitoring performance and energy metrics of Intel processors. Provides real-time monitoring of key metrics including memory bandwidth, cache miss latencies, PCIe bandwidth, and energy states. Available on Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, and ChromeOS.

**Intel® PerfSpect** - A comprehensive performance engineering toolkit that monitors CPU metrics, reports system configuration and health, collects system telemetry, generates flamegraphs from call-stacks, and modifies performance-related configuration settings.

**Intel® VTune™ Profiler** - An optimization tool for application and system performance analysis across AI, HPC, cloud, IoT, and storage workloads. Capabilities include identifying microarchitecture and memory bottlenecks, optimizing accelerators, analyzing parallelism, and multi-node analysis.
